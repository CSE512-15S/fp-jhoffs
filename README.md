I completed this project on my own by augmenting Vega.

Additional information on this project is available at http://cse512-15s.github.io/fp-jhoffs/

This project was a continuation of ongoing research in the Interactive Data Lab. At the start of the quarter I conducted interviews with external Vega users. These interviews suggested that linking between the visualization and internal representation was an interesting area of future research. The interviews also pointed out that observing changes in the data would be the most beneficial area of future work for debugging the specification and visualization. As I worked on this project, I updated the direction it took based on the types of information that could be surfaced to provide insight into into the behavior of end-user interaction. Based on the results of the example use case discussed in the paper, I think the best area of future work would be to explore more direct representaitons of the underlying data and how it changes over time.
