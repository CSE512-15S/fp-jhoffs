      <p>
        Vega is a declarative visualization language that enables rapid 
        iteration of visualizations and supports retargeting, while 
        allowing designers to focus on visual encoding instead of 
        low-level implementation details. However, these advantages 
        come at the cost of effective debugging due to obfuscation of
        the underlying program execution. To support debugging, this 
        project augments the development process by visualizing the 
        scenegraph in addition to the specification and visualization. 
        End-user interaction and inspection of the visualization update 
        the scenegraph to provide relevant context.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Software</h2>
      <p>
        You can try Vega and the scenegraph visualization online 
        <a href="main.html">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scenegraph is a tree representation of the final
        visualization where nodes in the tree represent different
        components of the output visualization. The tree is dynamically
        updated as users interact with the visualization. The following
        is a list of features in the scenegraph representation.
      </p>

      <h3>General Features</h3>

      <strong>Data on Demand</strong>
      <p>
        The user can right-click nodes in the scenegraph to print the
        corresponding data to the console.
      </p>

      <strong>Collapse/Expand</strong>
      <p>
        Selecting nodes in the scenegraph collapses or expands them.
        Collapsed nodes are represented with a black border. The size
        of collapsed nodes is indicative of the number of hidden
        descendants of that node.
      </p>
      <p>
        The control buttons in the "Scenegraph" bar allow the user to
        rapidly expand or collapse nodes. "Show All" expands all nodes
        to show all nodes in the tree. "Auto Collapse" collapses nodes
        for which the number of children exceeds some threashold.
      </p>

      <strong>Modify Scenegraph</strong>
      <p>
        "Remove Axis" and "Remove Legend" removes nodes corresponding
        to these components from the scenegraph visualization. These
        nodes are <emph>not</emph> removed from the visualization, but
        are simply hidden from the user's view of the scenegraph. The
        user can select these buttons again to restore the nodes.
      </p>

      <h3>Interaction Mode</h3>
      <p>
        While in the "Interaction" mode, the user can complete end-
        user interactions for the Vega visualization. As the user
        interacts with the visualization, the scenegraph is grayed out.
        Once the user stops interacting, the scenegraph is updated to
        show how the final state has changed from the initial state of
        the visualization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The color of the node (as shown in the legend) is representative 
        of the percentage of hidden descendant nodes that have changed 
        in some way. The stroke color of the node denotes the update
        status of that node (either 
        <span style="color:orange;">modified</span>, 
        <span style="color:limegreen;">added</span>,
        or <span style="color:red;">removed</span>.
      </p>

      <h3>Inspection Mode</h3>
      <p>
        The user can select the "Inspect" button to change from the
        interact mode to instead inspect elements of the visualization.
        In this mode, end-user interaction is disabled. Instead, when
        the user clicks the visualization, all nodes containing the
        point are highlighted in the scenegraph in 
        <span style="color:pink;">pink</span>.
      </p>
